## What Will You Get Here?

In this tutorial you will get the factorial of a number given by the user. The proper number that will be used is an integer greater than or equal 0.

## What Is The Right Order?

First you will be given a prompt to write a number. In mathematics the factorial (denoted by n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. So you must always give a non-negative integer because otherwise you will get a ValueError. 

Next, the factorial function (number_factorial(n)) will be called.

## What Is The Output Of The Code?

The output should look like this:

    >>> number_factorial(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: n must be >= 0

    >>> number_factorial(1)
    1

    >>> number_factorial(12)
    479001600

Notice that as the result you will be given the factorial of the number n.
